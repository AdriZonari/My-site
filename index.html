                <h2 class="professional-life">My professional life</h2>
                <p class="professional-life-text">I have a wide experience in different kind of business and was an entrepreneur during a long time within
                    sales, export and food production.
                    <br> I have social skills since customers prospection, sales and after sales was a great part of my job.
                    I got Business skills after an University degree in Marketing, as well as many years administrating and
                    promoting myself and the business.
                    <br>
                    <br> I am structured due to a long career competing and teaching in the equestrian sport.
                    <br>Running a food production company also required a lot of structure and precision. Both equestrian and
                    food business requires the eye for details and discipline.
                    <br><br> Last year I took part in a great IT project at IKEA where I learned the principles of Agile, including
                    Scrum and Kanban. I was responsible for a communication package to the App including SEO, ASO and SEM.
                    Also last year I graduated in a web development 1,5 year course which gave me most of my web development
                    skills. <br><br> I am now looking for opportunities as a junior web developer. I do have a lot to learn and am longing to start
                    in a company where I am able to develop as a professional as well as adding value to the projects to come. 
                    <br><br> If you find my profile interesting and would like to know more about my degrees and professional life,
                    have a look at my CV.<br><br>
