        <h2 class="professional-life">My professional life</h2>
        <p class="professional-life-text">I have a wide experience in different kind of business and was an entrepreneur during a long time within
             sales, export and food production.<br> I have social skills since customers prospection, sales and after sales was a great part of my job. I got Business skills after an University 
             degree in Marketing, as well as many years administrating and promoting myself and the business.<br><br>
            I am structured due to a long career competing and teaching in the equestrian sport. <br>Running a food production
             company also required a lot of structure and precision. Both equestrian and food business requires the eye for details and discipline. <br> 
             Last year I took part in a great IT project at IKEA where I learned the principles of Agile, including Scrum and Kanban. I was responsible for a communication package to the App
             including SEO, ASO and SEM. Also last year I graduated in a web development 1,5 year course which gave me most of my web development skills.<br> If you find my profile interesting
             and would like to know more about my degrees and professional life, have a look at my CV. </p>
